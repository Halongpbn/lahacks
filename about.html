<p> <center>To help people find places to park their bikes. </center></p>
<p style= "font-size: 30px;"><center> A B O U T </center></p>
<p><blockquote> At Cyclr, we worked to develop a website that could help
  bicyclist find easier parking spots. Throughout everyday
  situations, we have constantly seen people using their bicycles as
  transportation to go to work or simply exercise. We have seen people
  struggle to find nearby biking racks in order to park. Thus, we have came
  up with the idea of this website.

<p><blockquote>
  We would also like to promote the transportation of biking. We are all members
  of the Green Team at Carlmont High School. This topic is very important to us
  and we would like to spread the enviornmental ideas to all.
  Everyday, the majority of people uses cars to go to
  their destinations. This impacts our enviornment
  greatly through the amount of carbon dioxide intoxicating the air. Although
  this amount may not be as much compared to factories, we would like
  to lessen the amount of carbon emissions in our atmosphere. With this in mind, we
  have developed this website in order to encourge everyone to bike more often.
